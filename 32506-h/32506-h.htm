<h3>WHERE ARE THE WILLS TO BE DEPOSITED?</h3>

  <p>The difficulties thrown in the way of all literary and historical
  inquiries, by the peculiar constitution of the Prerogative Office,
  Doctors' Commons, have long been a subject of just complaint. An attempt
  was made by <span class="sc">The Camden Society</span>, in 1848, to
  procure their removal, by a Memorial addressed to the Archbishop of
  Canterbury, which we now print, because it sets forth, plainly and
  distinctly, the nature and extent of those difficulties.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"To the Most Rev. and the Right Hon. The Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p class="cenhead">"The humble Memorial of the President and Council
of the Camden Society, respectfully showeth,</p>

  <p>"That the Camden Society was instituted in the year 1838, for the
  publication of early historical and literary remains.</p>

  <p>"It has the honour to be patronised by H.R.H. the Prince Albert; and
  has supported, from its institution, by the countenance and subscription
  of your Grace's predecessor in the See of Canterbury.</p>

  <p>"The Society has published forty volumes of works relating to English
  History, and continues to be actively engaged in researches connected
  with the same important branch of literature.</p>

  <p>"In the course of its proceedings, the Society has had brought under
  its notice the manner in which the regulations of the Prerogative Office
  in Doctors' Commons interfere with the accuracy and completeness of works
  in the preparation of which the Council is now engaged, and with the
  pursuits and labours of all other historical inquirers; and they beg
  leave respectfully to submit to your Grace the results of certain
  investigations which they have made upon the subject.</p>

  <p>"Besides the original wills deposited in the Office of the Prerogative
  Court, there is kept in the same repository a long series of register
  books, containing copies of wills entered chronologically from <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1383 to the present time. These registers or
  books of entry fall practically into two different divisions or classes.
  The earlier and the latter books contain information suited to the wants
  of totally different kinds of persons, and applicable to entirely
  different purposes. Their custody is also of very different importance to
  the office. The class which is first both in number of books and in
  importance contains entries of modern wills. These are daily consulted by
  relatives of testators, by claimants and solicitors, principally for
  legal purposes, and yield a large revenue to the office in fees paid for
  searches, inspections, and copies. The second class, which comprises a
  comparatively small number of volumes, contains entries of ancient wills,
  dated before the period during which wills are now useful for legal
  purposes. These are never consulted by lawyers or claimants, nor do they
  yield any revenue to the office, save an occasional small receipt from
  the Camden Society, or from some similar body, or private literary
  inquirer.</p>

  <p>"With respect to the original wills, and the entries of modern wills,
  your memorialists beg to express clearly that this application is not
  designed to have any reference to them. Your memorialists confine their
  remarks exclusively to the books of entries of those ancient wills which
  have long and unquestionably ceased to be useful for legal purposes.</p>

  <p>"These entries of ancient wills are of the very highest importance to
  historical inquirers. They abound with illustrations of manners and
  customs; they exhibit in the most authentic way the state of religion,
  the condition of the various classes of the people, and of society in
  general; they are invaluable to the lexicographer, the genealogist, the
  topographer, the biographer,&mdash;to historical writers of every order
  and kind. They constitute the most important depository in existence of
  exact information relating to events and persons of the period to which
  they relate.</p>

  <p>"But all this information is unavailable in consequence of the
  regulations of the office in which the wills are kept. All the books of
  entry, both of ancient and modern wills, are kept together, and can only
  be consulted in the same department of the same office, in the same
  manner and subject to precisely the same restrictions and the same
  payments. No distinction is made between the fees to be paid by a
  literary person who wishes to make a few notes from wills, perhaps three
  or four hundred years old, in order to rectify a fact, a name, a date, or
  to establish the proper place of a descent in a pedigree, or the exact
  meaning of a doubtful word, and the fees to be paid by the person who
  wants a copy of a will proved yesterday as evidence of a right to
  property perhaps to be established in a court of justice. No extract is
  allowed to be made, not even of a word or a date, except the names of the
  executors and the date of the will. Printed statements in historical
  books, which refer to wills, may not be compared with the wills as
  entered; even ancient copies of wills handed down for many generations in
  the families of the testators, may not be examined in the registered
  wills without paying the office for making new and entire copies.</p>

  <p>"No such restrictions exclude literary inquirers from the British
  Museum, where there are papers equally valuable. The Public Record
  Offices are all open, either gratuitously or upon payment of easy fees.
  The Secretary of State for the Home Department grants permission of
  access to her Majesty's State Paper Office. Your Grace's predecessor gave
  the Camden Society free access to the registers of wills at
  Lambeth&mdash;documents exactly similar to those at Doctors' Commons. The
  Prerogative Office is, probably, the only public office in the kingdom
  which is shut against literary inquirers.</p>

  <p>"The results of such regulations are obvious. The ancient wills at
  Doctors' Commons not being accessible to those to whom alone they are
  useful, yield scarcely any fees to the office; historical inquirers are
  discouraged; errors remain uncorrected; statements of facts in historical
  works are obliged to be left uncertain and incomplete; the researches of
  the Camden Society and other similar societies are thwarted; and all
  historical inquirers regard the condition of the Prerogative Office as a
  great literary grievance.</p>

<p><!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216"></a>{216}</span></p>

  <p>"The President and Council of the Camden Society respectfully submit
  these circumstances to your Grace with a full persuasion that nothing
  which relates to the welfare of English historical literature can be
  uninteresting either to your Grace personally, or to the Church over
  which you preside; and they humbly pray your Grace that such changes may
  be made in the regulations of the Prerogative Office as may assimilate
  its practice to that of the Public Record Office, so far as regards the
  inspection of the books of entry of ancient wills, or that such other
  remedy may be applied to the inconveniences now stated as to your Grace
  may seem fit.</p>

  <p>As the Archbishop stated his inability to afford any relief, <span
  class="sc">The Camden Society</span> availed themselves of the
  appointment of the Commission to inquire into the Law and Jurisdiction of
  the Ecclesiastical and other Courts in relation to Matters Testamentary,
  to address to those Commissioners, in the month of January, 1853, a
  Memorial, of which the following is a copy:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To the Right Honourable and Honourable the Commissioners appointed by
  Her Majesty to inquire into the Law and Jurisdiction of the
  Ecclesiastical and other Courts in relation to Matters Testamentary.</p>

  <p>"My Lords and Gentlemen,</p>

  <p>"We, the undersigned, being the President and Council of the Camden
  Society, for the Publication of Early Historical and Literary Remains,
  beg to submit to your consideration a copy of a Memorial presented on the
  13th April, 1848, by the President and then Council of this Society, to
  his Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, praying that such changes might
  be made in the regulations of the Prerogative Office as might assimilate
  its practice to that of the Public Record Office, so far as regards the
  inspection of the books of entry of ancient Wills, or that such other
  remedy might be applied to the inconveniences stated in that Memorial as
  to his Grace might seem fit.</p>

  <p>"In reply to that Memorial his Grace was pleased to inform the
  Memorialists that he had no control whatever over the fees taken in the
  Prerogative Office.</p>

  <p>"The Memorialists had not adopted the course of applying to his Grace
  the Archbishop until they had in vain endeavoured to obtain from the
  authorities of the Prerogative Office, Messrs. Dyneley, Iggulden, and
  Gostling, some modification of their rules in favour of literary
  inquirers. The answer of his Grace the Archbishop left them, therefore
  without present remedy.</p>

  <p>"The grievance complained of continues entirely unaltered up to the
  present time.</p>

  <p>"In all other public repositories to which in the course of our
  inquiries we have had occasion to apply, we have found a general and
  predominant feeling of the national importance of the cultivation of
  literature, and especially of that branch of it which relates to the past
  history of our own country. Every one seems heartily willing to promote
  historical inquiries. The Public Record Offices are now opened to persons
  engaged in literary pursuits by arrangements of the most satisfactory and
  liberal character. His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury gives
  permission to literary men to search such of the early registers of his
  See as are in his own possession at Lambeth. Access is given to the
  registers of the Bishop of London; and throughout the kingdom private
  persons having in their possession historical documents are almost
  without exception not only willing but anxious to assist our inquiries.
  The authorities of the Prerogative Office in Doctors' Commons, perhaps,
  stand alone in their total want of sympathy with literature, and in their
  exclusion of literary inquirers by stringent rules, harshly, and in some
  instances even offensively, enforced.</p>

  <p>A Report from that Commission has been laid before Parliament; and a
  Bill for carrying into effect the recommendations contained in such
  Report, and transferring the powers of the Prerogative Court to the Court
  of Chancery, has been introduced into the House of Lords. The Bill
  contains no specific enactments as to the custody of the Wills.</p>

  <p>Now, therefore, is the time for all who are interested in Historical
  Truth to use their best endeavours to procure the insertion of such
  clauses as shall place the Wills under the same custody as the other
  Judicial Records of the country, namely, that of Her Majesty's Keeper of
  Records.</p>

  <p>With Literature represented in the House of Lords by a Brougham and a
  Campbell, in the Commons by a Macaulay, a Bulwer, and a D'Israeli, let
  but the real state of the case be once made public, and we have no fear
  but that the interests of English Historical Literature will be cared for
  and maintained.</p>

<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>"J. R. OF CORK."</h3>

  <p>My gifted and lamented countryman "The Roscoe of Cork"<a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> deserves more
  notice in these pages, which he has enriched by his contributions, than
  the handsome obituary of our Editor (Vol. vii., p. 394.); so a few words
  is with reference to him may be acceptable.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. James Roche</span> was born in Limerick some
  eighty-three years ago, of an ancient and wealthy family. At an early
  period of his life he was sent to France, and educated in the Catholic
  College of Saintes. After completing his studies, and paying a short
  visit to Ireland, he settled in Bordeaux, where he became acquainted with
  the most distinguished leaders of the Girondists.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Roche</span> was in Paris during the horrors of
  the first Revolution, and in 1793 was arrested there as a British
  subject, but was released on the death of Robespierre. For some years
  after his liberation, he passed his time between Paris and Bordeaux. At
  the close of the last century, he returned to Ireland; and commenced
  business in Cork as a banker, in partnership with his brother. He resided
  in a handsome country seat near the river Lee, and there amassed a
  splendid library.</p>

  <p>About the year 1816, a relative of mine, a wealthy banker in the same
  city, got into difficulties, and met with the kindest assistance from
  <span class="sc">Mr. Roche</span>. In 1819 his own troubles came on, and
  a monetary crisis ruined him as well as many others. All his property was
  sold, and his books were brought to the hammer, excepting a few with
  which his creditors presented him. I have often tried, but without
  success, to get a copy of the auction catalogue, which contained many
  curious lots,&mdash;amongst others, I am informed, Swift's own annotated
  copy of <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>, which <span class="sc">Mr.
  Roche</span> purchased in Cork for a few pence, but which produced pounds
  at the sale. <span class="sc">Mr. Roche</span>, after this, resided for
  some time in London as parliamentary agent. He also spent several years
  in Paris, and witnessed the revolution of 1830. Eventually he returned to
  Cork, where he performed the duties of a magistrate and director of the
  National Bank, until his death in the early part of 1853.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Roche</span> was intimately acquainted with many
  of the great men and events of his time, especially with everything
  concerning modern French history and literature.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Roche</span> was remarkable for accurate
  scholarship and extensive learning: the affability of his manners, and
  the earnestly-religious tone of his mind, enhanced his varied
  accomplishments.</p>

  <p>For a number of years he contributed largely to various periodicals,
  such as the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, the <i>Dublin Review</i>, and
  the <i>Literary Gazette</i>; and the signature of "J. R. of Cork" was
  welcome to all, while it puzzled many.</p>

  <p>In 1851 he printed <i>for private circulation</i>, <i>Essays Critical
  and Miscellaneous</i>, by an Octogenarian, 2 vols.; printed by G. Nash,
  Cork. Some of these Essays are reprints, others are printed for the first
  time. The work was reviewed in the <i>Dublin Review</i> for October,
  1851.</p>

  <p>A "Sketch of J. R. of Cork" was published in July, 1848, in Duffy's
  <i>Irish Catholic Magazine</i>, which I have made use of in this Note. My
  object in the present Note is to suggest that <span class="sc">Mr.
  Roche's</span> Reminiscences and Essays should be given to the public,
  from whom I am well assured they would receive a hearty welcome.</p>

<h3>MARMORTINTO, OR SAND-PAINTING.</h3>

  <p>There appeared in a late number of <i>The Family Friend</i>, an
  article on the above process. The writer attributes its invention to
  Benjamin Zobel of Bavaria; and states, that although some few persons
  have attempted its revival, in no instance has success attended such
  efforts. This is not correct. There was a German confectioner to King
  George III. whom I knew well. His name was Haas; and those acquainted
  with Bristol will recollect his well-frequented shop, nearly opposite the
  drawbridge on the way to College Green, where he resided forty years ago,
  after retiring from his employment at Court. There he was often engaged
  in decorating ceilings, lying on his back for weeks together on a
  scaffold for the purpose. He also ornamented the plateaus for the royal
  table; and he understood the art of sand-painting, and practised it in
  the highest perfection. Whether he preceded Zobel, or came after him, at
  Windsor Castle, I cannot tell; but I can testify that he was perfect
  master of the art in question. I have seen him at work upon his
  sand-pictures. He had the marble dust of every gradation of colour in a
  large box, divided into small compartments; and he applied it to the
  picture by dropping it from small cones of paper.</p>

  <p>The article in <i>The Family Friend</i> describes the process of Zobel
  to have consisted of a previous coating of the panel for the picture with
  a glutinous solution, over which the marble dust was strewed from a piece
  of cord. Haas used small cones of paper; and my impression from seeing
  him at work was, that he sprinkled the sand on the dry panel, and fixed
  the whole finally at once by some process which he kept a secret. For I
  remember how careful he was to prevent the window or door from being
  opened, so as to cause a draught, before he had fixed his picture; and I
  <!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page218"></a>{218}</span>have heard him lament the misfortune of
  having had one or two pictures blown away in this manner.</p>

  <p>The effect of his sand-pictures was extraordinary. They stood out in
  bold relief, and with a brilliancy far surpassing any oil painting. As
  may be supposed, this style of painting was particularly adapted for
  landscapes and rocky scenery; and it enabled the artist to finish foliage
  with a richness which nothing could surpass. Mr. Haas' collection of his
  sand-paintings was a rich treat to inspect. After his death, they were
  sold and dispersed; but many must be found in the collections of
  gentlemen in Bristol and its neighbourhood.</p>

<h3>LEADING ARTICLES OF FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS.</h3>

  <p>The foreign correspondence of the English press is an invaluable
  feature of that mighty engine of civilisation and progress, for which the
  world cannot be too thankful; but as the agents in it at Paris, Berlin,
  Vienna, &amp;c., are more or less imbued with the insular views and
  prejudices which they carry with them from England, Scotland, or Ireland,
  it were well if the daily journals devoted more attention than they do to
  the <i>leading articles</i> of the Continental press, which is frequently
  distinguished by great ability and interest, and would <!-- Page 219
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>{219}</span>enable
  Englishmen, not versed in foreign languages, to judge, from another point
  of view, of Continental affairs&mdash;now becoming of surpassing interest
  and importance. Translations or abstracts of the leading articles of
  <i>The Times</i>, <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, <i>Morning Post</i>, &amp;c.,
  are constantly to be met with in the best foreign papers. Why should not
  our great London papers more frequently gratify their readers with
  articles from the pens of their Continental brotherhood? This would
  afford an opportunity also of correcting the false statements, or
  replying to the erroneous judgments put forth and circulated abroad by
  writers whose distinguished position enables them, unintentionally no
  doubt, to do the more mischief. A surprising change for the better,
  however, as respects Great Britain, is manifest in the tone and
  information of the foreign press of late years. Let us cherish this good
  feeling by a corresponding demeanour on our part.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Materials for a History of Druidism.&mdash;</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It would be a commendable, useful, and easy task to collect what the
  ancients have left us on the subject of Druidism. Such a collection would
  form a very small but interesting volume. It would supersede, in every
  library, the idle and tedious dreams and conjectures of the Stukeleys,
  the Borlases, the Rowlands, the Vallanceys, the Davies's, the Jones's,
  and the Whitakers. Toland's work on the Druids, though far from
  unexceptionable, has more solid intelligence than any other modern
  composition of its kind. It is a pity that he or some other person has
  not given as faithful translations of the Irish Christian MSS. which he
  mentions, as these have, no doubt, preserved much respecting Druidical
  manners and superstitions, of which many vestiges are still existing,
  though not of the kind usually referred to."</p>

  <p>"The Roman history of Britain can only be collected from the Roman
  writers; and what they have left is very short indeed. It might be
  disposed of in the way recommended for the History of the
  Druids."&mdash;Douce's notes on Whitaker's <i>History of Manchester</i>,
  vol. i. p. 136. of Corrections in Book i., ibid. p. 148.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Anon.</span></p>

  <p><i>Domestic Chapels.</i>&mdash;There is an interesting example of a
  domestic chapel, with an upper chamber over it for the chaplain's
  residence, and a ground floor underneath it for some undiscoverable
  purpose, to be seen contiguous to an ancient farm-house at Ilsam, in the
  parish of St. Mary Church, in the county of Devon.</p>

  <p>The structure is quite ecclesiastical in its character, and appears to
  have been originally, as now, detached from the family house, or only
  connected with it by a short passage leading to the floor on which the
  chapel itself stood.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John James.</span></p>

  <p><i>Ordinary.</i>&mdash;The following is a new meaning for the word
  <i>ordinary</i>:&mdash;"Do ye come in and see my poor man, for he is
  <i>piteous ordinary</i> to-day." This speech was addressed to me by a
  poor woman who wished me to go and see her husband. He was ordinary
  enough, although she had adorned his head with a <i>red</i> night-cap;
  but her meaning was evidently that he was far from well; and Johnson's
  <i>Dictionary</i> does not give this signification to the word.</p>

  <p>A cottage child once told me that the dog opened his mouth "a power
  wide."</p>

  <p><i>Thom's Irish Almanac and Official Directory for 1854.</i>&mdash;In
  the advertisement prefixed to this valuable compilation, which, according
  to the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, "contains more information about Ireland
  than has been collected in one volume in any country," we may find the
  following words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"All parliamentary and official documents procurable, have been
  collected; and their contents, so far as they bore on the state of the
  country, carefully abstracted; and where any deficiencies have been
  observable, the want has been supplied by applications to private
  sources, which, in every instance, have been most satisfactorily
  answered. He [Mr. Thom] is also indebted to similar applications to the
  ruling authorities of the several religious persuasions <i>for the
  undisputed accuracy of the ecclesiastical department of the
  Almanac</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I wish to call attention to the latter words; and in so doing, I
  assure you, I feel only a most anxious desire to see some farther
  improvements effected by Mr. Thom.</p>

  <p>I cannot allow "the undisputed accuracy of the ecclesiastical
  department," inasmuch as I have detected, even on a cursory examination,
  very many inaccuracies which a little care would certainly have
  prevented. For example, in p. 451. (<i>Ecclesiastical Directory</i>,
  Established Church and Diocese of Dublin), there are at least five grave
  mistakes, and four in the following page. These pages I have taken at
  random. I could easily point out other pages equally inaccurate; but I
  have done enough I think to prove, that while I willingly accord to the
  enterprising publisher the full meed of praise he so well deserves, a
  little more attention should be paid in future to the preparation of the
  ecclesiastical department.</p>

  <p><i>The English School of Painting.</i>&mdash;In a note to a volume of
  poems by Victor Hugo, published in 1836, occur these remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"M. Louis Boulanger, à qui ces deux ballades sont dédiées, s'est placé
  bien jeune au premier rang de cette nouvelle génération de peintres, qui
  promet d'élever notre école au niveau des magnifiques écoles d'Italie,
  d'Espagne, de Flandre, et d'Angleterre."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Does this praise of the English school of painting show a correct
  appreciation of its claims to distinction? or am I in error in supposing,
  as I have done, that our school of painting is not entitled to the
  pompous epithet of "magnifique," nor to be named in the same category
  with the Italian, Spanish, and Flemish schools? I am aware of the
  hackneyed and somewhat hyperbolical employment, by French writers and
  speakers, of such terms as <i>magnifique</i>, <i>superbe</i>,
  <i>grandiose</i>; and that they do not convey to a French ear the same
  idea of superiority, as they do to our more sober English judgment; but
  making every allowance on this score, I confess I was not a little
  startled to find such a term as <i>magnifique</i>, even in its most
  moderate acceptation, applied to our efforts in that branch of art.
  <i>Magnifique</i>, in truth, must be our school, when the French can
  condescend to speak of it in such language!</p>

  <p>"<i>A Feather in your Cap.</i>"&mdash;My good friend Dr. Wolff
  mentioned in conversation a circumstance (also stated, I fancy, in his
  <i>Journey to Bokhara</i>) which seemed to afford a solution of the
  common expression, "That's a feather in your cap." I begged he would give
  it me in writing, and he has done so. "The Kaffr Seeyah Poosh (meaning
  the infidels in black clothing) living around Cabul upon the height of
  the mountains of the Himalaya, who worship a god called Dagon and Imra,
  are great enemies of the Muhamedans; and for each Muhamedan they kill,
  they wear a feather in their heads. The same is done among the
  Abyssinians and Turcomans."</p>

  <p>Has the feather head-dress of the American Indian, and the eagle's
  feather in the bonnet of the Highlander, any connexion with keeping a
  score of the deaths of the enemies or game they have killed?</p>

<h3>DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE: LICENCES TO CRENELLATE.</h3>

  <p>Previous to the publication of the second volume of the <i>Domestic
  Architecture of the Middle Ages</i>, you were kind enough to insert some
  Queries for me respecting existing remains of houses of the fourteenth
  century, which elicited some useful Notes, partly through your columns
  and partly from private friends who were thus reminded of my wants. I am
  now preparing for the press the third and concluding volume of that work,
  comprising the period from the reign of Richard II. to that of Henry
  VIII. inclusive. I shall be glad of information of any houses of that
  period remaining in a tolerably perfect state, in addition to those
  mentioned in the <i>Glossary of Architecture</i>. I have reason to
  believe that there are many; and one class, the halls of the different
  guilds, seem to have been generally overlooked.</p>

  <p>With the kind assistance of Mr. Duffus Hardy, I have obtained a
  complete list of the licences to crenellate contained in the Patent
  Rolls, and some other records preserved in the Tower. Most of these have
  the name of the county annexed; but there are a few, of which I add a
  list, in which no county is mentioned, and local information is necessary
  in order to identify them. Perhaps some <!-- Page 221 --><span

<h3>DIXON OF BEESTON.</h3>

  <p>Will the Editor be kind enough to insert the accompanying letter, for
  <i>if true</i> it is worthy of a place in the heraldic portion of "N.
  &amp; Q.," and <i>if not true</i>, its imposture should stand recorded?
  On receiving it I sent a copy to my brother, Mr. J. H. Dixon, an able
  antiquary, and late of the council of the Percy Society, who, somewhat
  too hastily I think, and without sufficient proof, rejected the
  information offered. That the family which my brother represents is a
  "good old" one, is sufficiently attested by the pedigree furnished by
  Thoresby in the <i>Ducatus Leodiensis</i>, and thence copied by Mr. Burke
  in his <i>Landed Gentry</i>; but of its earlier history there is no
  reliable account, unless that by Mr. Spence can be considered such.</p>

  <p>I shall feel very much obliged if any of your correspondents learned
  in the genealogies of Yorkshire and Cheshire could either corroborate the
  genuineness of the information tendered by Mr. Spence, or prove the
  reverse; and it is only fair to that gentleman to add that he is entitled
  to credibility on the written testimony of the Rev. Mr. Knox, Incumbent

      <p>Sir,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Having been engaged by Miss Cotgreave, of Notherlegh House, near
  Chester, to inspect and arrange the title-deeds and other documents which
  belonged to her father, the late Sir John Cotgreave, I find a very
  ancient pedigree of the Cotgreaves de Hargrave in that county; which
  family became extinct in the direct male line in the year 1724, but which
  was represented through females by the above Sir J. C.</p>

  <p>It is the work of the great Camden, anno 1598, from documents in the
  possession of the Cotgreave family, and contains the descents of five
  generations of the Dixons of Beeston, in the county of York, and
  Congleton, Cheshire, together with their marriages and armorial bearings,
  commencing with "Ralph Dixon, Esq., de Beeston and Congleton, living
  temp. Hen. VI., who was slain whilst fighting on the part of the
  Yorkists, at the battle of Wakefield, <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1460."</p>

  <p>Presuming that you are descended from this ancient family, I will (if
  you think proper) transmit to you extracts from the aforesaid pedigree,
  as far as relates to your distinguished progenitors, conditionally that
  you remunerate me for the information and definition of the armorial
  bearings, there being five shields, containing twelve quarterings
  connected with the family of Dixon.</p>

  <p>Miss Cotgreave will allow me to make the extracts, and has kindly
  consented to attest the same.</p>

  <p>The arms of Dixon, as depicted in the Cotgreave pedigree, are "Sable,
  a fleur-de-lis or, a chief ermine," quartering the ensigns of the noble
  houses of "Robert Fitz-Hugh, Baron of Malpas in the county of Chester,
  temp. William the Conqueror; Eustace Crewe de Montalt, Lord of Hawarden,
  Flintshire, during the said reign; Robert de Umfreville, Lord of Tours,
  and Vian, and Reddesdale, in Northumberland, who flourished in the same
  reign also; Pole, Talboys, Welles, Latimer," and others.</p>

  <p>In the pedigree, Camden states that the aforesaid "Ralph Dixon
  quartered the ensigns of the above noble families in right of his mother
  Maude, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Ralph Fitz-Hugh de Congleton and
  Elton in the county palatine of Chester."</p>

  ascribes their bearing <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Bunyan's Descendants.</i>&mdash;As a recent Query respecting John
  Bunyan may lead to some notices of his descendants, perhaps I may be
  informed in what edition of his works it is stated that a branch of his
  family settled in Nottingham? for I find in the burgess-roll of that
  borough that George Bunyan was entered freeman in 1752. William Bunyan,
  lieutenant in the navy, 1767; Thomas Bunyan, hosier, 1776. In event of
  the above story being verified, a pedigree may possibly be extracted
  hereafter from the parish registers of the town. As far as my own
  examination goes, the editions in the British Museum afford no
  corroboration to what I have heard.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Furvus.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Plumstead Common.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We have been favoured with the following article on this subject from
  George Offor, Esq., of Hackney:</p>

  <p>"<i>Where are John Bunyan's Descendants?</i>&mdash;It is natural to
  inquire after the ancestors and descendants of great men, although
  experience proves that intellectual greatness runs not in blood, for
  earth's <i>great</i> and most illustrious sons descended from and left
  descendants who merged among the masses of her <i>little</i> ones. Of his
  ancestors Bunyan boasted not, but pleaded with the readers of the first
  edition of his <i>Sighs from Hell</i>, 'Be not ashamed to own me because
  of my low and contemptible descent in the world.' From the life of the
  great dreamer, appended to my second edition of Bunyan's works (Blackie,
  Glasgow), it appears that he left three children: Thomas, a valuable
  member of his church; Joseph, who settled in Nottingham; and Sarah.
  Joseph is named by one of Bunyan's earliest biographers, who told his
  father that 'a worthy citizen of London would take him apprentice without
  money, which might be a great means to advance him; but he replied to me,
  <i>God did not send him to advance his family, but to preach the
  Gospel</i>.'</p>

  <p>"The Rev. J. H. A. Rudd of Bedford and Elstow has most kindly searched
  the registers of Elstow and Goldington, and has discovered some
  interesting entries; and, as his numerous engagements will permit, he
  will search the registry of the parish churches in Bedford and its
  vicinity. Information would be most acceptable relative to Bunyan's
  father and mother, his two wives, and his children, John, Elizabeth, and
  Mary, who died in his life-time; and also as to Joseph. If your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Furvus</span> would search the registers
  at Nottingham, he might discover some valuable records of that branch of
  the family. Bunyan is said to have been baptized about 1653; and in the
  Elstow register it appears that his daughter Mary was registered as
  <i>baptized</i> July 20, 1650, while his next daughter, Elizabeth, is on
  the register as <i>born</i> April 14, 1654, showing the change in his
  principles, as to infant baptism, to have taken place between those
  periods. The family Bible given by John Bunyan to his son Joseph, now in
  my possession, confirms the statement verbally communicated to me by his
  descendant Mrs. Senegar, that her great-grandfather Joseph, having
  conformed to please his rich wife, was anxious to conceal his affinity to
  the illustrious tinker. The registers contained in it begin with Joseph's
  son Thomas and Susannah his wife, and it is continued to Robert Bunyan,
  born 1775, and who was lately living at Lincoln. I should be most happy
  to show the Bible and copies of registers in my possession to any one who
  will undertake to form a genealogy."</p>

  <p class="author">S. Z. Z. S.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[From the fact, that this epigram was not only attributed to Pope, in
  the notes to the second edition of <i>The Dunciad</i>, published in 1729,
  but also in those of 1743, the joint edition of Pope and Warburton, and
  both published before the death of Pope, it seems extremely probable that
  he was the author of it; more especially as he had been exasperated by a
  twopenny tract, of which Dennis was suspected to be the writer, called
  <i>A True Character of Mr. Pope and his Writings</i>; printed for S.
  Popping, 1716. D'Israeli however, in his <i>Calamities of Authors</i>,
  art. "The Influence of a bad Temper in Criticism," quoting it from Dr.
  Johnson, conjectures it was written on the following occasion: "Thomson
  and Pope charitably supported the veteran Zoilus at a benefit play, and
  Savage, who had nothing but a verse to give, returned them very poetical
  thanks in the name of Dennis. He was then blind and old, but his critical
  ferocity had no old age; his surliness overcame every grateful sense, and
  he swore as usual, 'They could be no one's but that <i>fool</i>
  Savage's,' an evidence of his sagacity and brutality. This perhaps
  prompted 'the fool' to take this fair revenge and just chastisement."
  After all, Dr. Johnson, who was at that time narrating Savage's intimate
  acquaintance with Pope, may have attributed to the former what seems to
  have been the production of the latter.]</p>

  <p><i>Football played on Shrove Tuesday.</i>&mdash;The people of this and

  <p>["Shrove-tide," says Warton, "was formerly a season of extraordinary

  presided over the sports of the youth for six days before Ash Wednesday.
  Some traces of these festivities still remain in our Universities." In
  these degenerate days more is known, we suspect, of pancakes and
  fritters, than of a football match and a cock-fight:&mdash;the latter, we
  are happy to say, is now almost forgotten among us. As to the pancake

  <p><i>Vossioner; its Meaning.</i>&mdash;In looking over a parcel of brass
  rubbings made some years since, I find the word <i>vossioner</i> used,
  and not knowing its signification, I should be glad to be enlightened on
  the subject; but, in order to enable your readers to judge more
  correctly, I think it better to copy the whole of the epitaph in which
  the word occurs. The plate is in Ufton Church, near Southam, county
  Warwick; it measures eighteen inches in width by sixteen deep.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Here lyeth the boddyes of Richard Hoddomes, Parsson and Pattron and
  <i>Vossioner</i> of the Churche and Parishe of Oufton, in the Countie of
  Warrike, who died one Mydsomer Daye, 1587. And Margerye his Wiffe
  w<sup>th</sup> <i>her</i> seven Childryn, as namelye, Richard,
  <i>John</i>, and <i>John</i>, Anne, Jane, Elizabeth, Ayles, <i>his</i>
  iiii Daughters, <i>whose soule</i> restethe with God."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I give the epitaph <i>verbatim</i>, with its true orthography. There
  are some curious points in this epitaph. First, the date of the death of
  the clergyman only is given; second, the children are called <i>hers</i>,
  while the four daughters are <i>his</i>; and two of the sons bear the
  same Christian name, whilst only one <i>soul</i> is said to rest with
  God. The family is represented kneeling. Above the inscription, and
  between the clergyman and his lady, is a desk, on which is represented
  two books lying open before them.</p>

<h3>CLARENCE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., p. 85.)</p>

  <p>Clarence is beyond all doubt the district comprehending and lying
  around the town and castle of Clare in Suffolk, and not, as some have
  fancifully supposed, the town of Chiarenza in the Morea. Some of the
  crusaders did, indeed, acquire titles of honour derived from places in
  eastern lands, but certainly no such place ever gave its name to an
  honorary feud held of the crown of England, nor, indeed, has <i>ever</i>
  any English sovereign to this day bestowed a territorial title derived
  from a place beyond the limits of his own nominal dominions; the latest
  creations of the kind being the earldoms of Albemarle and Tankerville,
  respectively bestowed by William III. and George I., who were both
  nominally kings of Great Britain, <i>France</i>, and Ireland. In ancient
  times every English title (with the exception of Aumerle or Albemarle,
  which exception is only an apparent one) was either personal, or derived
  from some place in England. The ancient earls of Albemarle were not
  English peers by virtue of that earldom, but by virtue of the tenure of
  lands in England, though, being the holders of a Norman earldom, they
  were known in England by their higher designation, just as some of the
  <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page225"></a>{225}</span>Barons De Umfravill were styled, even in
  writs of summons, by their superior Scottish title of Earl of Angos. If
  these earls had not held English fees, they would not have been peers of
  England any more than were the ancient Earls of Tankerville and Eu. In
  later times the strictness of the feudal law was so far relaxed, that in
  two or three instances English peers were created with territorial titles
  derived from places in the Duchy of Normandy.</p>

  <p>As to the locality of Clarence, see Sandford's <i>Genealogical
  History</i>, 1707, p. 222. There is a paper on the subject in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for November, 1850. The king of arms called
  Clarenceux, or in Latin <i>Clarentius</i>, was, as it has been very
  reasonably conjectured, originally a herald retained by a Duke of
  Clarence. (Noble's <i>History of the College of Arms</i>, p. 61.) Hoping
  ere long to send you some notes respecting certain real or seeming
  anomalies amongst our English dignities, I reserve some particulars which
  may, perhaps, farther elucidate the present question.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Goldencross.</span></p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Honoré de Mareville</span> has
  wandered too far in going to the Morea to search for this title. Clare in
  Suffolk was one of the ninety-five manors in that county bestowed by the
  Conqueror upon Richard Fitzgilbert, who (as well as his successor
  Gilbert) resided at Tunbridge, and bore the surname of De Tonebruge. His
  grandson Richard, the first Earl of Hertford, fixed his principal seat at
  Clare, and thenceforth the family took the surname of De Clare; and in
  the Latin documents of the time the several members of it were styled
  <i>Ricardus</i> (or <i>Gilbertus</i>), <i>Dominus Clarensis</i>, <i>Comes
  Hertfordiensis</i>. The name of the lordship thus becoming the family
  surname, it is easy to see how in common usage the formal epithet
  <i>Clarensis</i> soon became Clarence, and why Lionel, the son of Edward
  III., upon his marriage with Elizabeth de Burgh, the grand-niece and
  heiress of the last Gilbertus Clarensis, should choose as the title for
  his dukedom the surname of the great family of which he had now become
  the representative.</p>

<h3>MILTON'S WIDOW.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 12. 134. 200. 375. 452. 471. 544.
594.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Garlichithe</span> is again on the wrong scent. In
  his first communication on this subject, he allowed himself to go astray
  by mistaking Randle Minshull the <i>grandfather</i> for Randle Minshull
  the <i>son</i>; and now, with the like fatality, he fails to discriminate
  between Richard Minshull the <i>uncle</i>, and Richard Minshull the
  <i>brother</i>, of Elizabeth Milton. A second examination of my Reply in
  Vol. viii., p. 200., will suffice to show him that Richard Minshull, the
  party to the deed there quoted, was named by me as the <i>brother</i>,
  and not the <i>uncle</i>, of Milton's widow, and that therefore his
  argument, based on disparity of age, &amp;c., falls to the ground. On the
  other hand, Richard Minshull of Chester, to whom the letter alluded to
  was addressed, was the brother of Randle Minshull of Wistaston, and by
  the same token, uncle of Elizabeth Milton, and of Richard Minshull, her
  brother and co-partner in the deed already referred to.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Garlichithe</span>, and all others who have taken an
  interest in this discussion, will now, I trust, see clearly that there
  has been nothing adduced by either <span class="sc">Mr. Marsh</span> or
  myself inconsistent with ages or dates; but that, on the contrary, all
  our premises and conclusions are borne out by evidence clear,
  irreproachable, and incontestable.</p>

  <p>All objections being now, as I conceive, fully combated and disposed
  of, the substance of our investigations may be summed up in a very few
  words. The statement of Pennant, adopted by all succeeding writers, to
  the effect that Elizabeth, the widow of John Milton, was a daughter of
  Sir Edward Minshull of Stoke, is clearly proved to be a fiction. It has
  been farther proved, from the parish registers, as well as from bonds and
  other documentary evidence, that she was, without doubt, the daughter of
  Randle Minshull of Wistaston, a village about three miles from Nantwich;
  that she was the cousin of Milton's familiar friend, Dr. Paget, and as
  such became entitled to a legacy under the learned Doctor's will, and
  that she is expressly named by Richard Minshull as his sister in the deed
  before quoted.</p>

<h3>THREE FLEURS-DE-LYS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., pp. 35. 113.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Devoniensis</span> is informed that an example of
  this occurs in the arms of King James's School, Almondbury, Yorkshire.
  The impression, as taken from the great seal of the school, in which
  however the colours are not distinguished, may be imperfectly described
  as follows: Three lions (two over one) passant gardant &mdash;&mdash;, on
  a chief &mdash;&mdash;, three fleurs-de-lys &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

  <p>As it is not unlikely that some other of King James's foundations may
  have the same arms, it would be considered a favour if any reader of "N.
  &amp; Q." possessing the information would communicate the proper colours
  in this case, or even the probable ones.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Camelodunensis.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Devoniensis</span> is quite right in supposing that
  the bearing of three fleurs-de-lys alone, horizontal, in the upper part
  of the shield,&mdash;in other words, <!-- Page 226 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>{226}</span>in chief,
  fess-ways,&mdash;is a very rare occurrence. I know of no instance of it
  in English blazon. Coupled with another and principal charge, as a fess,
  a chevron, a lion, &amp;c.; or in a chief, it is common enough. Nor have
  I ever met with an example of it in French coat-armour. An English
  family, named Rothfeld, but apparently of German extraction, gives:
  Gules, two fleurs-de-lys, in chief, ermine. Du Guesclin bore nothing like
  a fleur-de-lys in any way. The armorial bearings of the famous Constable
  were: Argent, a double-headed eagle, displayed, sable, crowned, or,
  debruised of a bend, gules.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">John o' the Ford.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Malta.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Since writing the above, I have read three replies (Vol.
  ix., p. 84.), which do not appear to me to exactly meet the Query of
  <span class="sc">Devoniensis</span>.</p>

  <p>I understand the question to be, does any English family bear simply
  three fleurs-de-lys, in chief, fess-ways&mdash;without any additional
  charge? And in that sense my reply above is framed.</p>

  <p>The first example given by <span class="sc">Mr. Mackenzie
  Walcott</span> would be most satisfactory and conclusive of the existence
  of such a bearing, could it be verified; but, unfortunately, in the
  <i>Heraldic Dictionaries</i> of Berry and Burke, the name even of
  Trilleck or Trelleck does not occur. And in Malta, I have no opportunity
  of consulting Edmondson or Robson.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent A. B. (p. 113.) has mistaken the three white lilies
  for fleurs-de-lys in the arms of Magdalen College, Oxford. Waynflete, the
  founder, was also Provost of Eton, and adopted the device from the
  bearings of that illustrious school; by which they were borne in allusion
  to St. Mary, to whom that College is dedicated.</p>

<h3>BOOKS BURNED BY THE COMMON HANGMAN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 272. 346. 625.; Vol. ix., p. 78.)</p>

  <p>The well-known law dictionary, entitled <i>The Interpreter</i>, by
  John Cowel, LL.D., was burned (1610) under a proclamation of James I.
  (D'Israeli's <i>Calamities of Authors</i>, ed. 1840, p. 133.)</p>

  <p>In June, 1622, the Commentary of David Pare, or Paræus <i>On the
  Epistle to the Romans</i>, was burned at London, Oxford, and Cambridge,
  by order of the Privy Council. (Wood's <i>Hist. and Antiq. of Univ. of
  Oxford</i>, ed. Gutch, vol. ii. pp. 341-345.; Cooper's <i>Annals of
  Cambridge</i>, vol. iii. pp. 143, 144.)</p>

  <p>On the 12th of February, 1634, <i>Elenchus Religionis Papisticæ</i>,
  by John Bastwicke, M.D., was ordered to be burned by the High Commission
  Court. (Prynne's <i>New Discovery of the Prelates' Tyranny</i>, p.
  132.)</p>

  <p>On the 10th of February, 1640-1 the House of Lords ordered that two
  books published by John Pocklington, D.D., entitled <i>Altare
  Christianum</i>, and <i>Sunday no Sabbath</i>, should be publicly burned
  in the city of London and the two Universities, by the hands of the
  common executioner; and on the 10th of March the House ordered the
  Sheriffs of London and the Vice-Chancellors of both the Universities,
  forthwith to take care and see the order of the House carried into
  execution. (<i>Lords' Journals</i>, vol. iv. pp. 161. 180.)</p>

  <p>On the 13th of August, 1660, Charles II. issued a proclamation against
  Milton's <i>Defensio pro Populo Anglicano</i>, his <i>Answer to the
  Portraiture of his Sacred Majesty in his Solitude and Sufferings</i>, and
  a book by John Goodwin, late of Coleman Street, London, Clerk, entitled
  <i>The Obstructors of Justice</i>. All copies of these books were to be
  brought to the sheriffs of counties, who were to cause the same to be
  publicly burned by the hands of the common hangman at the next assizes.
  (Kennett's <i>Register and Chronicle</i>, p. 207.) This proclamation is
  also printed in Collet's <i>Relics of Literature</i>, with the inaccurate
  date 1672, and the absurd statement that no copy of the proclamation was
  discovered till 1797.</p>

  <p>In January, 1692-3, a pamphlet by Charles Blount, Esq., entitled
  <i>King William and Queen Mary, Conquerors, &amp;c.</i>, was burned by
  the common hangman in Palace Yard, Westminster. (Bohun's
  <i>Autobiography</i>, ed. S. W. Rix, vol. xxiv. pp. 106, 109. 113.;
  Wilson's <i>Life of De Foe</i>, vol. i. p. 179 <i>n</i>.)</p>

  <p>The same parliament consigned to the flames Bishop Burnet's
  <i>Pastoral Letter</i>, which had been published 1689. (Wilson's <i>Life
  of De Foe</i>, vol. i. p. 179.)</p>

  <p>On the 31st of July, 1693, the second volume of Anthony à Wood's
  <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i> was burned in the Theatre Yard at Oxford by the
  Apparitor of the University, in pursuance of the sentence of the
  University Court in a prosecution for a libel on the memory of Edward
  Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. (<i>Life of Mr. Anthony à Wood</i>, ed. 1772, p.
  377.)</p>

  <p>On the 25th of February, 1702-3, the House of Commons ordered De Foe's
  <i>Shortest Way with the Dissenters</i> to be burned by the hands of the
  common hangman on the morrow in New Palace Yard. (Wilson's <i>Life of De
  Foe</i>, vol. ii. p. 62.)</p>

  <p>In or about 1709, John Humphrey, an aged non-conformist minister,
  having published a pamphlet against the Test, and circulated it amongst
  the members of parliament, was cited before a committee, and his work was
  ordered to be burned by the common hangman. (Wilson's <i>Life of De
  Foe</i>, vol. iii. p. 52.)</p>

  <p>The <i>North Briton</i>, No. 45., was on the 3rd of December, 1763,
  burned by the common hangman at the Royal Exchange, by order of the House
  of <!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page227"></a>{227}</span>Commons. The following account is from
  Malcolm's <i>Anecdotes of London</i>, 4to., 1808, p. 282.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The 3rd of December was appointed for this silly ceremony, which took
  place before the Royal Exchange, amidst the hisses and execrations of the
  mob, not directed at the obnoxious paper, but at Alderman Harley, the
  sheriffs, and constables, the latter of whom were compelled to fight
  furiously through the whole business. The instant the hangman held the
  work to a lighted link it was beat to the ground, and the populace,
  seizing the faggots prepared to complete its destruction, fell upon the
  peace-officers and fairly threshed them from the field; nor did the
  alderman escape without a contusion on the head, inflicted by a bullet
  thrown through the glass of his coach; and several other persons had
  reason to repent the attempt to burn that publicly which the <i>sovereign
  people</i> determined to approve, who afterwards exhibited a large
  <i>jack-boot</i> at Temple Bar, and burnt it in triumph, unmolested, as a
  species of retaliation."</p>

<h3>DIFFERENT PRODUCTIONS OF DIFFERENT CARCASES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vi., p. 263.)</p>

  <p>Up to a very recent period, it was held, even by philosophers, that
  each of the four elements, as well as every <i>living</i> plant and
  animal, both <!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page228"></a>{228}</span>brute and human, generated insects; but of
  all sources of this equivocal generation, none was considered more potent
  than the putrefaction or corruption of animal matter: as Du Bartas
  says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"God, not contented to each kind to give,</p>
      <p>And to infuse the virtue generative,</p>

      <p>Of <i>lifeless bodies</i> without Venus' deed."</p>
      <p class="i12"><i>Sixth Day.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Pliny, after giving Virgil's receipt for making bees, gives similar
  instances:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Like as dead horses will breed waspes and hornets; and asses carrion,
  turne to be beetle-flies by a certaine metamorphosis which Nature maketh
  from one creature to another."&mdash;Lib. xi. c. xx.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And soon after he says of wasps:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"All the sorte of these live upon flesh, contrarie to <i>the manner of
  bees, which will not touch a dead carcasse</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This brings Shakepeare's lines to mind:</p>

  <p>The <i>Belfast News Letter</i> of Friday, Aug. 10, 1832, gives one of
  these rare occurrences:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A few days ago, when the sexton was digging a grave in Temple Cranney
  (a burying-place in Portaferry, co. Down), he came to a coffin which had
  been there two or three years: this he thought necessary to remove. In
  this operation, he was startled by a great quantity of wild bees issuing
  forth from the coffin; and upon lifting the lid, it was found that they
  had formed their combs in the dead man's skull and mouth, which were
  full. The nest was made of the hair of the head, together with shavings
  that had been put in the coffin with the corpse."</p>

<h3>VANDYKE IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 182. 228.)</p>

  <p>To your correspondent C. I would say, that his observation&mdash;that
  the Query was as to an <i>engraving</i>, whilst my answer was as to a
  <i>picture</i>&mdash;is not true; as I am sure, from memory, that <span
  class="sc">Mr. Westmacott</span> used the word "portraits." But I plead
  in extenuation of my pretended grave offence, 1. That the Query was not
  propounded by C., but by a gentleman to whom the information given might
  be, as I supposed, of some interest; more particularly as I referred to
  the <i>Travels</i> of an Englishman, both of which, author and work, were
  accessible. 2. That, in common with the American readers of "N. &amp;
  Q.," I regarded it as "a journal of inter-communication," through whose
  columns information might be asked for, the request to be treated with
  the same consideration and courtesy as though addressed to each
  individual subscriber. I may add that <span class="sc">Lord
  Braybrooke</span> and <span class="sc">Mr. Wodderspoon</span> (Vol. iv.,
  p. 17.) have urged "the necessity for recording the existence of painted
  historical portraits, scattered, as we know they are," &amp;c. <!-- Page
  229 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>{229}</span></p>

  <p>Now, as to the expression "worthies, famous in English history." I
  presume I need do no more concerning its application to Lord Orrery, Sir
  Robert Walpole, &amp;c., than say, it was used as signifying "men of
  mark," without intending to endorse their "worth" either morally,
  mentally, or politically; its application to Colonel Hill and Colonel
  Byrd, as meaning "men of worth," might, did your limits permit, be
  defended on high grounds.</p>

  <p>Then as to the possibility of Vandyke's having painted the portraits.
  If C. will have the kindness to look at C. Campbell's <i>History of
  Virginia</i>, he will find,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1654. At a meeting of the Assembly, William Hatchin, having been
  convicted of having called Colonel Edward Hill 'an atheist and
  blasphemer,' was compelled to make acknowledgment of his offence upon his
  knees before Colonel Hill and the Assembly."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This Colonel Hill, generally known as Colonel Edward Hill the Elder, a
  gentleman of great wealth, built the mansion at Shirley, where his
  portrait, brought from England, hangs in the same place, in the same hall
  in which he had it put up. It represents a youth in pastoral costume,
  crook in hand, flocks in the background. By a comparison of dates, C.
  will find it possible for Vandyke to have painted it. (See Bryan's
  <i>Engravers and Painters</i>.) It has descended, along with the estate,
  to his lineal representative, the present owner. Its authenticity rests
  upon <i>tradition</i> coupled with the foregoing facts, as far as I know
  (though the family may have abundant documentary proof), and I doubt very
  much whether many "Vandykes in England" are better ascertained. I would
  add that several English gentlemen, among them, as I have heard, a
  distinguished ambassador recently in this country, recognised it as a
  Vandyke. This picture, amongst others, was injured by the balls fired
  from the vessels which ascended the James river, under command of General
  Arnold, then a British officer. On the younger Mr. Hill's tomb at Shirley
  is a coat of arms, a copy of which, had I one to send, would probably
  point out his family in England.<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As to Colonel Byrd's portrait. There were, I believe, three gentlemen
  of this name and title, more or less confounded in reputation, the second
  of whom, generally known as "Colonel Byrd the Elder," by reason of his
  son's history, was born in 1674. The picture is of his <i>father</i>,
  that is, of "old," or "the first Colonel Byrd," and is in the same style
  as that of Colonel Hill's, representing a shepherd lad. He was an English
  gentleman of great wealth, and certainly of some benevolence. In
  Campbell's <i>Virginia</i>, p. 104. (see also Oldmixon, vol. i. p. 427.),
  it is stated, 1690, a large body of Huguenots were sent to Virginia. "The
  refugees found in Colonel Byrd, of Westover, a generous benefactor. Each
  settler was allowed a strip of land running back from the river to the
  foot of the hill (Henrico County). Here they raised cattle," &amp;c. He
  sent his son to England to be educated under the care of a friend, Sir
  Robert Southwell. The son became a Fellow of the Royal Society, "was the
  intimate and bosom friend of the learned and illustrious Charles Boyle,
  Earl of Orrery," was the author of the <i>Westover MSS.</i> (mentioned in
  Oldmixon's preface, 2nd ed.), portions of which, "Progress to the Mines,"
  "History of the Dividing Line," &amp;c., have been printed, others are in
  the library of the American Philosophical Society.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> His portrait is "by Kneller, a fine
  old cavalier face," says Campbell. The letters received at Westover might
  prove not uninteresting even to C., seeing that there were so many titled
  people among the writers; and to a gentleman of education and
  intelligence, the Westover library would have been a treasure-house. In
  the Loganian Library in this city is a large MS. folio, whose title-page
  declares it to be "a catalogue of books in the library at Westover,
  belonging to William Byrd, Esq.," from which it appears that in Law there
  were the English reporters (beginning with Y. B.) and text-writers, laws
  of France, Scotland, Rome (various editions of Pandects, &amp;c.); Canon
  Law, with numerous approved commentators on each. In Physic a great many
  works, which, as I am told, were, and some still are, of high repute: I
  note only one, <i>Poor Planter's Physician interleaved</i>. This, to
  every one who has been upon a great Virginia plantation, bespeaks the
  benevolence characteristic of the proprietors of Westover. In Divinity,
  besides pages of orthodox divines, Bibles in various languages (several
  in Hebrew, one in seven vols.), are Socinius, Bellarmine, &amp;c. The
  works on Metallurgy, Natural History, Metaphysics, Military Science,
  Heraldry, Navigation, Music, &amp;c., are very numerous; and either of
  the collections of history, or entertainment, or classics, or political
  science, would form no inconsiderable library of itself. <!-- Page 230
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>{230}</span>An impression
  of Colonel Byrd's book-plate, given by a friend, is enclosed. I must add
  that the pictures at Brandon are at that mansion, through the marriage of
  Mr. Harrison (a signer of the Declaration of Independence) with the
  daughter of the third Colonel Byrd.</p>

  <p>I have occupied much more space than I intended, but I have said
  enough I hope to show, 1. That it is possible, from dates, from the
  character, wealth, and position of Mr. Byrd and Mr. Hill, together with
  the length of time the pictures have remained in the respective families,
  for Vandyke to have painted these portraits. 2. That as men who directed
  the energies, developed the resources, of our infant settlements, who
  brought hither the products of science, literature, and art, who
  exhibited the refinements of birth, the graces of good breeding, yet were
  always ready to serve their country in the field or in the council, Mr.
  Byrd and Mr. Hill are vastly more worthy of commemoration and reverence
  than all the Earls of Dredlington that ever sat at his majesty's Board of
  Green Cloth.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Cyanide of Potassium.</i>&mdash;It may be interesting to our
  photographic friends to know that cyanide of potassium is capable of
  replacing hyposulphite of soda in all collodion processes. If used of the
  strength of five grains to one ounce of water, no danger need be
  apprehended from it. Its merits are cleanliness, quickness of operation,
  and the minute quantity of water required for washing the picture fixed
  therewith.</p>

  <p><i>Mode of exciting Calotype Paper.</i>&mdash;I forgot inserting this
  plan of exciting in my paper: it is very clean and convenient, simple and
  sure. Obtain a piece of plate glass, two or three inches larger than your
  paper, level it on a table with a few bits of wood, pour on it your
  exciting mixture (say aceto-nitrate and gallic acid, solution of each 20
  minims, distilled water 1 ounce), and spread it evenly over with a scrap
  of blotting-paper. Float your paper two minutes, remove and blot off;
  this ensures perfect evenness, especially if the paper is large. You may
  thus excite half a dozen papers with little more trouble than one.</p>

  <p><i>The Double Iodide Solution&mdash;Purity of Photographic
  Chemicals.</i>&mdash;The observations of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Leachman</span> upon the solvent powers of iodide of potassium (Vol ix.,
  p. 182.) are perfectly correct, but I believe our photographic chemicals
  are often much adulterated. The iodide of potassium is frequently mixed
  with the carbonate. <span class="sc">Dr. Mansell</span> writes me word,
  in a comment upon your note upon his communication, "What I used was
  <i>very</i> pure, having been prepared by Mr. Arnold with great care: it
  was some that had gone to the Great Exhibition as a sample of Guernsey
  make, and obtained a medal." I have this day used exactly seven ounces
  avoirdupois to make a pint of the iodizing solution, which, within a few
  grains, agrees with my former results. Nitrate of silver, I am informed
  upon a most respectable authority, has been adulterated thirty per cent.,
  and without careful testing has eluded detection; but I am inclined to
  think our cheapest article has come in for its largest share of mixture.
  I have lately perfectly failed in the removal of the iodide of silver
  with a <i>saturated</i> solution of what I purchased as hyposulphite of
  soda, but which could have been little else than common Glauber's salts;
  for upon applying a similar solution of some which was made by M. Butka
  of Prague, and supplied me by Messrs. Simpson and Maule, the effect was
  almost immediate, demonstrating how much we are misled in our
  conclusions, from believing we are manipulating with the same substances,
  when in fact they are quite different.</p>

  <p><i>Hoby Family</i> (Vol. viii., p. 244.; Vol. ix., pp. 19.
  58.).&mdash;Sir Philip Hoby, or Hobbie, who was born in 1505, and died in
  1558, was not only Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Henry VIII., but,
  while he held that office, was attached to the embassy of Sir Thomas
  Wyatt to the Emperor Charles V. in 1538. He was himself ambassador to the
  same Emperor in 1548, being sent by the Protector Somerset to replace the
  Bishop of Westminster. It may be interesting to state that two volumes of
  papers containing instructions and other letters transmitted to Sir
  Philip during these embassies, and copies of his replies, together with
  his correspondence with some eminent reformers, were in the possession of
  Wm. Hare, Esq., M.P. for the city of Cork in 1796. An account of them,
  drawn up by the Rev. T. D. Hincks, was read before the Royal Irish
  Academy on December 17 in that year, and printed in the sixth volume of
  its <i>Transactions</i>. It is probable that these papers had formerly
  belonged to Rev. Sir Philip Hoby, Bart., who was Dean of Ardfert and
  Chancellor of St. Patrick's; and died without an heir in 1766. He was
  descended from Sir Thomas Hoby, younger brother of Sir Philip; who was
  born in 1530, and died in 1566. The father of these two knights was
  William Hobbie of Leominster. I presume the two volumes of papers
  referred to are in the possession of the Earl of Listowel, great-grandson
  of the gentleman who possessed them in 1796.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is strange, yet well authenticated, and has given rise to many
  theories, that the symbol of the Cross was already known to the Indians
  before the arrival of Cortez. In the island of Cozumel, near Yucatan,
  there were several; and in Yucatan itself there was a stone cross. And
  there an Indian, considered a prophet amongst his countrymen, had
  declared that a nation bearing the same as a symbol should arrive from a
  distant country! More extraordinary still was a temple, dedicated to the
  Holy Cross by the Toltec nation in the city of Cholula. Near Tulansingo
  there is also a cross engraved on a rock with various characters, which
  the Indians by tradition ascribe to the Apostle St. Thomas. In Oajaca,
  also, there existed a cross, which the Indians from time immemorial had
  been accustomed to consider as a divine symbol. By order of the Bishop
  Cervantes it was placed in a sumptuous chapel in the cathedral.

  of quarter sessions for the city, desiring their immediate care, that
  <i>those publick conveniences</i> may not be any longer delayed, but with
  all possible speed provided for the detection and quieting such
  disorderly persons."</p>

  <p>Another, the date of which is not given, but which is signed by the
  same foreman, presents "Alsoe that a ducking-stoole be made for publick
  use, being very much wanting for scolding women," &amp;c. And in 1720,
  another grand jury, of which Benjamin Duffield was foreman, say:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Grand Inquest, we taking in consideration the great disorders of
  the turbulent and ill-behaviour of many people in this city, we present
  the great necessity of a ducking-stool for such people according to their
  deserts."</p>

  <p><i>Double Christian Names</i> (Vol. ix., p. 45.).&mdash;It is surely
  not correct to say that the earliest instance of two Christian names is
  in the case of a person born in 1635. Surely Henry, Prince of Wales, the
  son of James I., is an earlier instance. Sir Thomas Strand Fairfax was
  certainly born before that date. Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey was probably an
  earlier instance; and Sir Robert Bruce Colton, the antiquary, certainly
  so. Writing at a distance from my books, I can only appeal to memory; but
  see Southey's <i>Common-Place Book</i>, vol. i. p. 510. Venables, in his
  <i>Travels in Russia</i>, <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page233"></a>{233}</span>tells us that "a Russian has never more
  than one Christian name, which must be always that of a saint." To these
  a patronymic is often added of the father's name, with the addition
  <i>vich</i>, as in the case of the present Czar, Nicholas Paulovich, the
  son of Paul.</p>

  <p><i>Pedigree to the Time of Alfred</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  586.).&mdash;Some ten or twelve years since I was staying at the King's
  Head Inn, Egham, Surrey (now defunct), when a fresh-looking, respectable
  man was pointed out to one as Mr. Wapshot, who had held an estate in the
  neighbourhood from his ancestors prior to the Conquest. He was not
  represented as a blacksmith, but as farming his own estate. I am not
  connected with Egham or the neighbourhood, or I would make farther
  inquiry.</p>

  <p><i>Palace of Lucifer</i> (Vol. v., p. 275.).&mdash;If R. T. has not
  observed it, I would refer him to the note in the Aldine edition of
  Milton, vol. iii. p. 263., where I find "Luciferi domus" is the palace of
  the sun (see <i>Prolusiones</i>, p. 120.); and not, as <span
  class="sc">T. Warton</span> conjectured, the abode of Satan.</p>

  <p class="author">I. R. R.</p>

  <p><i>Monaldeschi</i> (Vol. viii., p. 34.).&mdash;<i>Relation du Meurte
  de Monaldeschi, poignardé par ordre de Christine, reine de Suède</i>, by
  Father de Bel, is to be found in a collection of curious papers printed
  at Cologne, 1664, in 12mo. It is given at length in <i>Cristina's
  Revenge, and other Poems</i>, by J. M. Moffatt, London, printed for the
  author, 1821.</p>

  <p class="author">E. D.</p>

  <p><i>Anna Lightfoot</i> (Vol. vii., p. 595.).&mdash;T. H. H. is referred
  to an elegantly printed pamphlet called <i>An Historical Fragment
  relative to her late Majesty Queen Caroline</i>, printed for J. &amp; N.
  L. Hunt, London, 1824, which, from p. 44. to p. 50., contains a very
  circumstantial account of this extraordinary occurrence.</p>

  <p class="author">E. D.</p>

  <p><i>Lode</i> (Vol. v., p. 345.).&mdash;It would not appear that this
  word means "an artificial watercourse," at least from its use at
  Tewkesbury, where there is still the <i>Lower Lode</i>, at which a ferry
  over the Severn still exists; and there was also the <i>Upper Lode</i>,
  until a bridge was erected over the river at that place. Will this help
  to show its proper meaning?</p>

  <p class="author">I. R. R.</p>

  <p>"<i>To try and get</i>" (Vol. ix., p. 76.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Uneda</span> inquires the origin of this erroneous mode of
  expression? Doubtless euphony, to avoid the alliteration of so many T's:
  "<i>t</i>o <i>t</i>he <i>t</i>heatre <i>t</i>o <i>t</i>ry and get,"
  &amp;c. But evidently the word <i>to</i> is understood, though not
  supplied after the word <i>and</i>. Thus, "to try and (to) get,"
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><i>Abbott Families</i> (Vol. ix. p. 105.).&mdash;In reply to <span
  class="sc">Mr. Abbott's</span> Query, I have a pedigree of Samuel Abbott,
  born in 1637 or 1638; second son of Wm. Abbott of Sudbury, who was born
  1603, and who was son to Charles Abbott of Hawkden and Sudbury, an
  alderman, which Charles was son to Wm. Abbott of Hawkden. This Samuel
  married Margaret, daughter to Thomas Spicer. Should <span class="sc">Mr.
  Abbott</span> wish it, I would forward him a copy of the pedigree. I can
  trace no connexion between this family and that of Archbishop Abbott,
  whose father, Maurice Abbott of Guildford, was son of &mdash;&mdash;
  Abbott of Farnham, co. Surrey.</p>

  <p>I wish especially to know what became of Thomas Abbott, only son of
  Robert, Bishop of Sarum; which Thomas dedicated his father's treatise
  against Bellarmine in 1619 to his uncle the Archbishop, calling himself
  in the preface, "imbellis homuncio." His sister was wife to Sir Nathaniel
  Brent, whose younger son Nathaniel left all his property to his cousin
  Maurice Abbott, of St. Andrew's, Holborn, Gent., in 1688; which Maurice
  was possibly son to Thomas.</p>

  <p class="address">36. Lincoln's Inn Fields.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mairdil</i>" (Vol. viii., p. 411.).&mdash;Is there any affinity
  between the word <i>mairdil</i>, which is used in Forfarshire, to be
  overcome with fatigue for any oppressive or intricate piece of work, and
  the word <i>mardel</i> or <i>mardle</i>, which signifies to gossip in
  Norfolk, as stated by <span class="sc">Mr. J. L. Sisson</span>? What will
  H. C. K. say to this subject? Jamieson confines <i>mairdil</i> to an
  adjective, signifying unwieldy; but I have often heard work-people in
  Forfarshire declare they were "perfectly <i>mairdiled</i>" with a piece
  of heavy work, using the word as a passive verb. <i>Trachled</i> has
  nearly the same meaning, but it is chiefly confined to describe fatigue
  arising from walking a long distance.</p>

  <p><i>Bell at Rouen</i> (Vol. viii., p. 448.).&mdash;Your valuable
  correspondent <span class="sc">W. Sparrow Simpson</span>, B.A., has
  probably taken his account of the great bell in the cathedral at Rouen
  from a note made before the French Revolution of 1792-3, because the
  George d'Ambois, which was once considered the largest bell in Europe (it
  was thirteen feet high, and eleven feet in diameter), excepting that at
  Moscow, shared the destructive fate of many others at that eventful
  period, and was melted down for cannon. In 1814 the bulb of its clapper
  was outside the door of a blacksmith's shop, as you go out of the city
  towards Dieppe. It was pointed out to me by a friend with whom I was then
  travelling&mdash;a gentleman of the neighbourhood, who was at Rouen at
  the time it was brought there&mdash;and there, if I mistake not, but I
  cannot find my note, I saw it again within the last ten years.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Before proceeding to notice any of the books which we have received
  this week, we will call the attention of the publishing world to two
  important works which we know to be now wanting a publisher, namely, I.
  <i>A Syriac-English Lexicon to the New Testament and Book of Psalms</i>,
  arranged alphabetically, with the derivatives referred to their proper
  roots, and a companion of the principal words in the cognate languages;
  and II. <i>A Syriac-English Grammar</i>, translated and abridged from
  Hoffman's larger work.</p>

  <p>Samuel Pepys is the dearest old gossip that ever lived; and every new
  edition of his incomparable Diary will serve but to increase his
  reputation as the especial chronicler of his age. Every page of it
  abounds not only in curious indications of the tone and feelings of the
  times, and the character of the writer, but also in most graphic
  illustrations of the social condition of the country. It is this that
  renders it a work which calls for much careful editing and illustrative
  annotation, and consequently gives to every succeeding edition new value.
  Well pleased are we, therefore, to receive from Lord Braybrooke a fourth
  edition, revised and corrected, of the <i>Diary and Correspondence of
  Samuel Pepys</i>. and well pleased to offer our testimony to the great
  care with which its noble editor has executed his duties. Thanks to his
  good judgment, and to the great assistance which he acknowledges to have
  received from Messrs. Holmes, Peter Cunningham, Yeowell, &amp;c., his
  fourth edition is by far the best which has yet appeared, and is the one
  which must hereafter be referred to as the standard one. The Index, too,
  has been revised and enlarged, which adds no little to the value of the
  book.</p>

  <p>Mr. Murray has broken fresh ground in his <i>British Classics</i> by
  the publication of the first volume of Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of
  the Roman Empire, with Notes and Preface by Dean Milman and M.
  Guizot</i>, and edited, with Notes, by Dr. Smith. If the publisher showed
  good tact in selecting Mr. P. Cunningham for editor of <i>Goldsmith</i>,
  he has shown no less in entrusting the editing of his new Gibbon to Dr.
  Smith, whose various Dictionaries point him out as peculiarly fitted for
  such a task. In such well practised hands, therefore, there can be little
  doubt as to the mode in which the labour of editing will be conducted;
  and a very slight glance at the getting up of this first volume will
  serve to prove that, for a library edition of Gibbon, while this is the
  cheapest it will be also the handsomest ever offered to the public.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;Macaulay's <i>Critical
  and Historical Essays, People's Edition</i>, Part I. The first issue of
  an edition of these admirable Essays, which will, when completed, cost
  only Seven Shillings! Can cheapness go much lower?&mdash;<i>Adventures in
  the Wilds of North America</i>, by Charles Lanman, <i>edited</i> by C. R.
  Wild, forming Parts LV. and LVI. of Longman's <i>Traveller's Library</i>.
  These adventures, partly piscatorial, are of sufficient interest to
  justify their publication even without the <i>imprimatur</i>, which they
  have received, of so good a critic as Washington Irving.&mdash;Darling's
  <i>Cyclopædia Bibliographica</i>, Part XVII., extends from Andrew Rivet
  to William Shepheard.</p>

  Improvements, and Enlargement. Also Historical Illustrations, Autographs,
  and Portraits. To be published in crown 8vo., Weekly, in Seventy-two
  Parts, at One Shilling each: and in Monthly Volumes, price Four
  Shillings, bound in cloth.</p>

  <p>The Publication will commence on the 3rd of April, and be continued
  regularly until the Work is completed.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the universal desire of obtaining the best books at
  the cheapest possible price, the Historical Works of HUME, SMOLLETT, and
  HUGHES, are now submitted to the public: it being the object of the
  Publisher to place within the reach of all classes of readers, in a
  succession of weekly parts and monthly volumes, a more complete HISTORY
  OF ENGLAND than any extant.</p>

  <p>The eventful period in the annals of Britain which has elapsed since
  the age of Smollett, whose volumes close with the reign of George the
  Second, demands a faithful and impartial record; and this portion of our
  National History, continued by the REV. T. S. HUGHES, late Christian
  Advocate at Cambridge, will be printed from the corrected text of the
  third octavo edition, which was almost entirely rewritten.</p>

  <p>The additional volumes, containing a narrative of important events,
  commence with the accession of George the Third, and will be continued to
  the accession of Queen Victoria.</p>

  <p>The Work will be completed in eighteen volumes, and embellished with
  numerous Engravings on Steel, entirely re-engraved for this Edition,
  comprising a selection of historical illustrations from Bowyer's History
  of England, and from paintings by the most eminent masters, with
  portraits of all the sovereigns from the Norman Conquest, according to
  the costume of the different ages, and authentic facsimiles of their
  autographs.</p>

  <p>THE SCOTTISH PROVIDENT INSTITUTION combines the advantage of
  Participation in the whole Profits with moderate Premiums.</p>

  <p>The premiums are as low as those of the non-participating scale of the
  proprietary companies. They admit of being so not only with safety, but
  with ample reversion of profits to the policy-holders, being free from
  the burden of payment of dividend to shareholders.</p>

  <p>At the first division of surplus in the present year, bonus additions
  were made to policies which had come within the participating class,
  varying from 20 to 54 per cent. on their amount.</p>

  <p>In all points of practice&mdash;as in the provision for the
  indefeasibility of policies, facility of licence for travelling or
  residence abroad, and of obtaining advances on the value of the
  policies&mdash;the regulations of the Society, as well as the
  administration, are as liberal as is consistent with right principle.</p>

  <p>Policies now issued free of stamp duty.</p>

  <p>Copies of the last annual report, containing full explanations of the
  principles, may be had on application to the Head Office in Edinburgh; of
